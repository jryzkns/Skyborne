Hello there, my name is Jack and I am here to talk to you about my game. In case you remember me from last year, I still can't see sharp because I never touched unity ever since the last game jam. However, seeing sharp is no longer the problem when love is blind. *put on sunglasses* Okay no I still need to see for this presentation

*pause*

*start to load the page*

I present to you, Skyborne Rhapsody. A commandline scifi narrative built: 

with love, with love.

We begin with the intro sequence here. The narrative takes place in the command center of a spaceship called HOPE-55. 

The ship has just finished its mission, and it's on its way to bring some important goods back into their home planet.

Our main character Chase manages the control system of this spaceship, and well, the computer's got a bit of an attitude to it.

*enter the commandline*

Oh, okay, so let's do "help" first. mm so there's {list out all the commands}.

Let's do inspect first {do inspect,  out the stats}.

Okay, what other commands do we have again? {type help again}. See I told you she has a bit of an attitude.

*pause*

okay, before we start im going to disclose that there is a good ending and a bad ending. Due to time I think we can only see one of the two. I will try to push for the good ending but I'm not really good at my own game..yikes

each main action has a chance of triggering a minigame

Anyways Let's start with propel. {run propel until minigame}
 
Now let's do prospect. {prospect until minigame}

if win, victory cutscene, mention the little episode with the spaceship.

roll credits. So this game is made with the following team uh.....

In short ma name jek

I had loads of fun jamming and lovin this weekend, I hope that you guys had a good time too, and I look forward to seeing the other games to be presented here. 

Thank you!
